# Tall-Talk
A random question generator to get people talking about interesting things, not just "small talk". 

I've always enjoyed deep conversations and dont care for "small talk", perhpas because 'i'm a Scorpio or perhaps because I'm 6'5" tall. 
Thats partly why I named this Tall Talk and not big talk or deep conversations, also those didnt roll oiff the tongue the way Talk Talk does.
